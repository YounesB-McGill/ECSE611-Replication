Make the \"username\" and \"password\" parameters required. Today\n   they default to the empty string, which doesn't make much sense.\n2. Change the internal resource name from \"nova\" to \"config\". The\n   name \"nova\" was confusing as the collection of MySQL statistics\n   is unrelated to Nova. With this change the generated collectd\n   configuration file is named \"mysql-config.conf\", which makes\n   more sense than \"mysql-nova.conf\" and is consistent with other\n   collectd config file names we have (e.g. \"python-config.conf\").\n3. Add a unit test for the class.\n4. Adjust the documentation.\n\nChange-Id: I281c28d9f4da7ae728615041e175845ad5829b34",
